# Gifing the Giftastic
## Using Bleach Characters and Themes

This was the fifth individual project for the University of Denver FullStack Coding Bootcamp.

This app plays around with displaying and showing GIF images through GIPHY around a topic or idea. It then returns those objects onto a webpage.

## Using the App on Github

Deployed at https://justin1732.github.io/HW6Giftasti/

## Starting the app locally

For a local version, I recommend using Visual Studio Code. Navigate over to my GitHub repo, located at https://github.com/justin1732/HW6Giftasti, click clone, and be sure to type in the following below:
git clone
Then navigate to the HTML file and load it.

## Using this application

Users can see the preloaded Bleach characters and the gifs that GIPHY most associates with those characters. Users can also add another character/subject matter in the blank field and by clicking "submit".

## Technologies Used

This application uses primarily HTML, Basic CSS, and Bootstrap CSS for rendering and viewing the elements. The app uses JQuery and Ajax to translate the information received from the user into a display.
